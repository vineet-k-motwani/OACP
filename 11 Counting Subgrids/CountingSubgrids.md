## Algorithm : 
- The algorithm takes a 2D boolean grid grid as input.
- Each element in the grid is either True (representing 1) or False (representing 0).
- Iterate over grid pairs: The algorithm iterates over all possible pairs of rows a and b in the grid where a < b. This nested loop ensures that we don't count the same subgrid twice (e.g., considering subgrid formed by row 1 and 2 is the same as considering subgrid formed by row 2 and 1).
- Count common ones: For each pair of rows a and b, the algorithm initializes a counter count to 0. Then, it iterates over all columns i in the grid and checks if the element at position (a, i) and (b, i) are both True (i.e., both are 1s). If they are, the count is incremented. This count essentially represents the number of columns where both rows a and b have a 1.
- Calculate subgrids: After iterating over all columns, the algorithm calculates the number of subgrids formed by rows a and b using the formula ((count - 1) * count) // 2. Here's the intuition behind the formula:
Imagine a row a with x ones and another row b with y ones (where x and y are the count we calculated earlier).
To form a valid subgrid, we need at least one 1 from each row. So, the total number of ways to choose those ones is x * y.
However, this overcounts the subgrids because if we pick a specific column with a 1 from row a, we can't pick the same column for the 1 from row b (they would be the same subgrid). So, we are essentially double-counting the subgrids x times (for each of the x ones in row a).
To account for this double counting, we subtract 1 from count (i.e., x - 1). This reduces the number of times we overcount each subgrid.
Finally, dividing by 2 corrects for the overcounting because for every subgrid, we've counted it once for each row that it belongs to.
- Sum subgrids: The algorithm adds the calculated number of subgrids formed by the current row pair (a and b) to the total count of subgrids (subgrids).
- Return result: After iterating over all possible row pairs, the algorithm returns the total count of subgrids (subgrids).
