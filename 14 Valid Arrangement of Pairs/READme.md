## Algorithm:

### Input
- Read the number of pairs `n`.
- Read `n` pairs of integers `a` and `b`, representing the pairs.

### Output
- If a valid arrangement is possible, output the path traversed and the arranged pairs.
- If no valid arrangement is possible, output "No Valid Arrangement Possible".

### Approach
1. Initialize an empty graph and a degree map.
2. For each pair ```(a, b)```:
   - Add an edge from a to b in the graph.
   - Increment the in-degree of b and decrement the out-degree of a.
3. Find the starting node for the Eulerian path:
   - If there is a node with an in-degree of 1, it's the start node.
   - If all nodes have even degrees, choose any node as the start node.
4. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find the Eulerian path.
   - Recursively visit adjacent nodes, removing edges as you traverse them.
   - Push the edges to the path in reverse order.
5. Reverse the path obtained.
6. If the length of the path is not equal to the number of pairs, output ```"No Valid Arrangement Possible"```.
7. Otherwise, output the path traversed and the arranged pairs.
